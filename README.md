### Hello :)
I am Polarian, you may wonder why a programmer has no repositories on github, and no they are not private. I will not use a platform which sells open source code *cough* *cough* copilot, this account is solely to not exclude myself from contributing on projects which are on github, I respect the wishes of the project owner, just I disagree personally and will stick with what I prefer. (see below)

Check me out on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/PolarianDev) (the superior platform) <br>
You can also add me on discord: `Polarian#7560` (although discord is also not one of the greatest platforms) <br>

My IRC:
- Hostname: `chat.polarian.dev` <br>
- Port: `6667` (unencrypted) or `6697` (tls encryption) <br>
- My username: PolarianDev <br>
- What channel? --> Join #main (Not very creative naming I know), warning this is bridged with discord and therefore the messages are persistant (you can check out the bridge I wrote [here](https://gitlab.com/PolarianDev/bridge.net))

Have a nice day and join the IRC revolution :P
