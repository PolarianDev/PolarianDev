### Hello :)
I am Polarian, you may wonder why a programmer has no repositories on github, and no they are not private. I will not use a platform which sells open source code *cough* *cough* copilot, this account is solely to not exclude myself from contributing on projects which are on github, I respect the wishes of the project owner, just I disagree personally and will stick with what I prefer. (see below)

Check me out on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/PolarianDev) (the superior platform) <br>
You can also add me on discord: `Polarian#7560` (although discord is also not one of the greatest platforms) <br>
You can contact me on XMPP: `polarian@xmpp.polarian.dev`
