### Hello :)

I am Polarian, you may wonder why a programmer has no repositories on Github, and no they are not private. I will not use a platform which sells open source code *cough* *cough* copilot, this account is solely to not exclude myself from contributing on projects which are on Github, I respect the wishes of the project owner, just I disagree personally and will stick with what I prefer. (see below)

Check me out on my [Gitea](https://git.polarian.dev/polarian) <br>
You can contact me on XMPP: `polarian@icebound.dev` <br>
You can email me at [polarian@polarian.dev](mailto:polarian@polarian.dev)

I am also active within Arch Linux, see:
